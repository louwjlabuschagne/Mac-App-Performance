# Mac-App-Performance
A python and bash based way to probe an application in Terminal on Mac.

## Plan
the plan for this is to piggy back the `top` command in the osx terminal and use `python` and the `plotly` library to have a way to get visual performance metrics by running a command similar to

```{bash}
app_probe iTunes
```

and get metrics like the headings found in sample1.txt
